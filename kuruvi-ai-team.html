        <article>
            <p>Last month, my AI bill was crushing me. Not because I was using ChatGPT for everything — I had built my own agent system called Nanoclaw. But here's the thing: <span class="highlight">having AI agents is easy. Having them not step on each other's toes? That's the hard part.</span></p>

            <p>So I did something counterintuitive. I upgraded every single agent to Opus (the most expensive Claude model) and added a whole orchestration layer on top. My costs dropped 80%.</p>

            <p>Here's how.</p>

            <h2>The Problem: AI Anarchy</h2>
            
            <p>I built Nanoclaw to be my personal assistant team. I had agents for coding, design, testing, architecture, product strategy, and research. The interface was WhatsApp. I'd message, agents would respond. Worked great... until it didn't.</p>

            <div class="callout">
                <p><strong>The breaking point:</strong> I asked Turing to implement a feature. Nitty started testing before Turing finished. Jony started designing UI for code that didn't exist yet. Everything collided. I spent 3 hours untangling the mess.</p>
            </div>

            <p>The real issue? <strong>No orchestration.</strong> Agents were just workers with no manager.</p>

            <h2>The Expensive Solution That Actually Saved Money</h2>

            <p>Everyone says "use the cheap model for simple tasks." But here's what nobody tells you: <span class="highlight">cheap models retry more.</span></p>

            <div class="cost-comparison">
                <div class="cost-card cost-before">
                    <div>Before (Sonnet)</div>
                    <div class="cost-amount">$180</div>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">~40% task failure rate<br>Avg 2.3 retries per task</p>
                </div>
                <div class="cost-card cost-after">
                    <div>After (Opus + Kuruvi)</div>
                    <div class="cost-amount">$35</div>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">~5% task failure rate<br>Avg 1.1 retries per task</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Opus costs 3x more per token. But when it actually <em>completes the task the first time</em>, you use way fewer tokens overall.</p>

            <h2>Enter Kuruvi: The Orchestration Layer</h2>

            <p>I built Kuruvi to solve the coordination problem. Here's how it works:</p>

            <h3>1. Task Queue System</h3>
            <p>Instead of agents running simultaneously, Kuruvi maintains a task queue. Each agent only starts when the previous one finishes. No collisions.</p>

            <h3>2. Docker Isolation</h3>
            <p>Every agent runs in its own Docker container with a fresh Claude session. When the task is done, the container dies. No context pollution.</p>

            <h3>3. Convex Backend</h3>
            <p>All task state lives in Convex (real-time database). Agents can see what's in progress, what's queued, what's done. Full visibility, zero race conditions.</p>

            <h3>4. Discord Notifications</h3>
            <p>Every completed task posts to Discord. I get a notification, can review the work, and approve or request changes.</p>

            <div class="callout">
                <p><strong>The magic:</strong> I went from managing 6 chaotic AI agents to managing 1 orchestrator that manages 6 disciplined AI agents. The cognitive load dropped by 90%.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Why This Matters</h2>

            <p>Everyone's building AI agents. But here's the thing: <strong>the hard part isn't the agent. It's the orchestration.</strong></p>

            <p>When you have one AI, you manage it. When you have ten, they need to manage each other. That's the unlock.</p>

            <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Quality > Quantity:</strong> One Opus call that works beats three Sonnet retries</li>
                <li><strong>Orchestration is Everything:</strong> Context matters more than capability</li>
                <li><strong>Fresh Sessions > Long Context:</strong> Kill the container, start clean</li>
                <li><strong>Async > Real-time:</strong> Task queues let agents work without blocking</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

            <p>I replaced 20 hours of manual AI wrangling per week with a $35/month orchestration system. The future isn't one super-intelligent AI. It's a bunch of specialized AIs that know when to talk and when to shut up.</p>
